However, like any WYSIWYG editor, the HTML it outputs is â€¦ sub-optimal. And it has some quirks and downright annoyances.\r\n\r\nFortunately, with a little JavaScript, we can fix some of those. This repo has bookmarklets to work some magic on Desire2Learn pages.\r\n\r\n## Bookmarklets\r\n### Display Raw LaTeX\r\nI know, crazy idea, right? This bookmarklet replaces those ugly yellow image placeholders with the actual, honest-to-goodness raw LaTeX you typed in. To edit your LaTeX, just click on the raw string, and it will revert to the placeholder image. The bookmarklet also takes care of that bug wherein D2L's editor doesn't recognize your ``\\( inline equation blocks \\)``.\r\n\r\nDrag this link to your bookmarks bar to install: [D2L - Display LaTeX](javascript:(function(){function e(){Bookmarklets.parseLatex()}if(0==$('script[src$=\"display_raw_latex.js\"]').size()){var a=document.createElement(\"script\");a.src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/tachyondecay/d2l_bookmarklets/a4a3d5634c7920582bd9b130d81248e0fc59b9b3/display_raw_latex.js\",a.addEventListener?a.addEventListener(\"load\",e,!1):a.readyState&&(a.onreadystatechange=e),document.body.appendChild(a)}else e()})();)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
